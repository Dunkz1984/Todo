# Todo List
To-Do list in Python


This is the first project from the RoadMap app.

This is also a first step into Python as a language.
I got a lot of help from online resources, but was satisfied enough that I understood the pieces together that I could do this again.

The learning from this was interesting. This is a challenge that, at first, appears simple, but then becomes more tricky as you move along. Conceptually, the process of object orientation made sense. Having main be just main() was easy for me to conceptualise.

The hard parts came from understanding new parts of the language and how they worked. This is like learning a new language in the real world - there are shortcuts that people familiar with the language will know that I do not.

Essentially the inclusion of a JSON file was the hard part for me to understand.

The json.read() was confusing for me. Whilst it is a very simple idea, I want to understand more about it. How exactly does the terminal "read" the code? Through what method? Does search and then literally read? If something is stored to memory, where and how? The process behind the function is extremely interesting to me. I would compare it to being able to drive a car. Whilst it is possible to drive a car without knowing what a clutch pedal does, it is much easier to use it correctly when I do know its general function within the code.

Another part that I found difficulty with was in the alteration of the JSON file through python. I found that the communication between the JSON and code took some getting used to. Deleting a part of the JSON file by literally copying and pasting it without the selected piece rather than having a delete() was unusual to me. Why have something that can read and write but not delete? These are the particularities that I will have to push through but will find difficult to really resolve in my head.
